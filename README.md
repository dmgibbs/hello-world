# hello-world
Just another repository
I'm really keen on the material i will be learning in the upcoming few weeks as I go thru new stuff and try to make sense of it all. Its been a while since I really focused myself on any one set of topics. Its hard to be patient and go slow as it seems there is so much to learn. I will admit compared to the days of B-trees and linked lists, it seems a little less complex. The event driven paradigm will take some getting used to.
Back on topic; I consider myself easy going, God Fearing and helpful. I'm a patient person, love outdoors & am interested in blockchains!!
